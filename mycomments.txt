Krispii-api extends krispii-core. I will look at core first.

Everything imports or extends one of the models in ca.shiftfocus.krispii.core.models:

1. Role: 
Gets a random user ID, create time and update time...

Case class Role and companion object, which defines JSON Writes
method.
Why is this marked as implicit? For other methods to use implicitly? Recommended by JSON in Play.
Weird pattern matching: double underscores mean JsPath, backslash means the value that belongs to the key given after the backslash. Role is unapplied (returns Option of a tuple), then unlisted to extract the tuple itself.

2 Tag:
Abstract class extends Ordered of itself ???
Companion object implements JSON Write of Tag. Looks simpler than for Role, not sure if the difference is relevant.

2. User
Several values in User are optional (Option can be Some or None).
User has an indexed sequence of Roles and one of Tags, and may have a Token.
